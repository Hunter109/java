Java is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its portability, readability, and robustness. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that make it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from web development to mobile app development and more.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented:** Java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code through the use of classes and objects.

- **Platform Independence:** Java applications can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it "write once, run anywhere."

- **Strongly Typed:** Java is a statically typed language, which means that type checking is done at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

- **Memory Management:** Java features automatic memory management through garbage collection, making it easier to manage memory resources.
